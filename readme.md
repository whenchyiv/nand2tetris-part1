### Projects:

- 01: Basic logic gates (and, or, xor, mux, dmux)
- 02: Boolean arithmetic chips (half and full adder, 16 bit adder, 16 bit incrimenter, ALU)
- 03: Sequential logic chips (bits, registers, ram)
- 04: Machine language (basic assembly programs)
- 05: Computer architecture (CPU, memory, full computer)
- 06: Assembler (Hack assembly language assembler for the computer created in the previous project)
